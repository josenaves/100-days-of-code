# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 29, 2017
##### Let the game begins

**Today's Progress**: Solve a FireCode.io problem (Matrix transpose + flip vertically). Practice a kata on CodeWars (about binary numbers).

**Thoughts:** I feel pretty confident about simple matrix algorithms. My goal is to get really good at this to pass Toptal challenge.
